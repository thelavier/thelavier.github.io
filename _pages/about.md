My name is Th√©o Lavier and I am a PhD student at Heriot-Watt University and Edinburgh University. In this website you will find my publications, talks, CV, and teaching.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie primarily in optimal transport and its interesections with fluid mechanics. I have spent the majority of my PhD working on using semi-discrete optimal transport to prove the existence and regularity of solutions to the compressible semi-geostrophic equations. These equations are used to study the evolution of weather fronts. Going forward I want to work on optimal transport theory and applying it to study Euler's equations, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the magnetohydrodynamic equations.  

I am also interested in developments in maths education and developing courses that implement the newest research about how to effectively teach maths. 

Interesting Simulations
======
Here are two simulations showcasing an incompressible isolated semi-geostrophic cyclone:
