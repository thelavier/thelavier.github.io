The semi-geostrophic equations for a compressible fluid, first analyzed by Cullen and
Maroofi [2003], provide a simplified model of the formation and evolution of atmospheric fronts. I
will discuss the use of semi-discrete optimal transport theory to rigorously prove the existence of
global-in-time weak solutions as the limit of spatially discrete approximations. This constructive
proof of the existence of weak solutions directly extends the work of Bourne et al. [2022] from
the incompressible to the compressible setting. I will also show some of the numerical results and
discuss the challenges we faced in implementing this numerical method.

This is joint work with David Bourne, Charlie Egan and Beatrice Pelloni.
