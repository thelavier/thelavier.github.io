We describe a mesh-free three-dimensional numerical scheme  for solving the incompressible semi-geostrophic equations based on semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. These results generalise previous two-dimensional implementations.  The optimal transport methods we adopt are known for their structural preservation and energy conservation qualities and achieve an excellent level of efficiency and numerical energy-conservation. We  use this scheme to generate numerical simulations of an important benchmark problem. To our knowledge, this is the first fully three-dimensional simulation of the semi-geostrophic equations, evidencing semi-discrete optimal transport as a novel, robust numerical tool for meteorological and oceanographic modelling.
